Full disclaimer. I don't consider myself a software developer. I would call myself a Web Applications Manager. I know enough to hire the right people for the job. I totally understand why full stack software developers get tight when they hear WordPress Web Developer. 

IMO WordPress is the best ice breaker on the internet. Their are millions of people who need help with their new brand or re-branding period. WP is a free platform and almost everyone at some point got suckered into buying a domain for 1.99 and thought they could build a great site that will make them millions of dollars in 15 minutes on WIX or Square SpaceðŸ˜‰. They were fooled. 

Personally with an RTVF and Graphic Design background, WP has gotten me out of some HUGE financial jams. I've collected several $2500 deposits just by demo-ing a few watermarked test photos and DSLR back ground B-Roll videos with the new mocked up logo I just designed for a semi interested client on a WP landing page. 

The elephant in the room is that the advantage to being savvy in WP is that their is a market for these companies that either cant afford or simply just don't want to pay a software developer $6k-$10k a month to build a website with custom web applications but they will set aside a $1500-$10k+ budget for professional photos, videos, web setup, css/html theme customization, scale-able hosting plan with dedicated email marketing solutions, social media API key integration, google business integration (google maps), eCommerce solutions, call to action links, surveys (survey monkey) and contact forms and then set aside a monthly retainer to manage and market it. 

Because WordPress is very SEO friendly, you can charge for separate SEO Optimization Packages that can help boost web rankings. You can outsource content development through sites like Fiverr and use free tools like Yoast to make sure your articles are SEO friendly. You can also charge clients to write weekly content for their blogs which help with google rankings, then share those articles on the major social media platforms to grow their brand. 

Social Media Management is a beast by itself. FB/YT/IG/Google are make billions off of ad sales. Because you hold all the credentials to their WP website passwords and social media API keys, by default you have become their social media manager/admin. Again you can outsource and charge your fee to manage all their social media and create custom FB ad packages that will get customers to their website to buy their products and services. 


Giving them a few teasers always helps  the client buy in. Most clients can't get enough of seeing themselves or their brand professionally photographed with custom graphic design displayed on their own website with the domain they've bought for $1.99 four Black Fridays ago. This also helps clients land investors and now you have become one of the most important people on their team. They can not function w/o you. 


They will always have a family friend they want to hire for this to save a few bucks but simply remind them that this is the probably the most important part of their business model and they will want future investors and customers to have access to their website and social media 24/7. They don't want to just hand the keys to a relative to save a few bucks and it is important to hire a professional.


Let me guess, the company is selling a product or a service..Great!  Even more money for you. Now you get to come up w/ your very own sales and marketing agreement. You have now become a creative director.  You can charge for video promos and graphic ad design, and set up professional photo shoots for their products and services. Again the market is so saturated good photogs and videographers you can get a few bids and outsource the work and keep the profits. Don't forget to include an affiliate marketing agreement for yourself, meaning you get a percentage of any sales you bring to the customer. 


Now that you have set them up with a website and professional content they will want business cards, brochures, explainer vids etc.and will be bragging about their new brand to all the important people in their life, including  investors, family members with money etc. Now its time for you to lock down those referrals and cut deals to get new business..maybe add a free 6 mo's of maintenance and support for each referral or throw in a referral fee for each person they bring. Now you have an awesome portfolio with solid referrals. 


Some businesses will need custom back end solutions like client management portals, project management portals, booking software (Booksy) and invoice software. Guess what you get to charge for those custom solutions, and you get to up-sell a training agreement for the clients staff and future new hires. Some clients will want you to teach them so they can learn for themselves and cut you out. For these  clients offer a monthly class and charge like crazy to make it worth your while DON'T do it for free. 


Ooops I forgot to tell you the coolest part. You get to do all this remote,  with no corporate micro managers breathing down your neck. Now your sitting in first class optimizing and editing the photos of the hot model you hired  and photo for a new lifestyle brand with your A7S in RAW in Adobe Lightroom for your first demo revision you are going to send off before landing in Bali. 


The money is in the maintenance and support agreement, sales and marketing agreement, content creation agreement, custom web application solutions, and your golden parachute the buyout agreement. 

Advice:
Don't get in bidding wars where you bid against the cheapest people on earth. Use your skills as conversation starters to find out where you can help new prospects and network like crazy. Stay affordable and reasonable in the beginning. You can always start with a team photo shoot or a CEO photo shoot to break the ice and get to the decision maker and pitch the re-brand with new photos. The key is to get leverage so you can weed out the cheap high maintenance difficult clients and keep the good ones. 


ENFORCE A BUYOUT CLAUSE. 
You may run into business partner with a different vision or the company gets sold and they want to hire a new team. Include a first right of refusal agreement with a worthy buyout amount that includes a percentage of all future income or they can keep you on the job as an alternative. This protects you for when politics get involved and they want to gran the contract to a buddy. Or if they company blows up fast and you have to scale up with the company but cant handle the work load. You could hire a full agency and get a percentage of the contract
